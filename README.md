What is Bloc-jams? 
------------------
Bloc Jams is a music application. It allows the user to play music with interactive scroll bars and volume controls using the latest [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) technology.

How does it work?
-----------------
Scroll through the landing page and view the random artwork that is presented. Afterword click on the Library button in the top right-hand side of the screen. It will take you to a different view instantly thanks to AngularJS and show you a myriad of albums. Click on a random album and play a song, but ensure that your volume is turned on.
